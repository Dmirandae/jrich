Description: To link phylogeny and conservation, evolutionary taxonomic distinctiveness indices are a feasible way for defining a ranking 
   of areas that takes into account the evolutionary history of each taxon that inhabits the area. 
   As our information could be incomplete or even could be misleading, there must be a measure to evaluate the sensitivity of the ranking 
   of the areas to modifications in the data used in the analysis. 
   The jack-knife resampling approach could evaluate the effect of modifications in the terminals of phylogenies included or excluded in 
   the analysis and therefore quantify the persistence of an area or areas in the prioritization ranking.
   The algorithm is described in: Miranda-Esquivel, D (2016) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_11>
