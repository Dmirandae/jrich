Description: These functions calculate the taxonomic measures presented in Miranda-Esquivel (2016). 
   The package introduces Jack-knife resampling in evolutionary distinctiveness prioritization analysis, 
   as a way to evaluate the support of the ranking in area prioritization, and the persistence of a given area 
   in a conservation analysis.
   The algorithm is described in: Miranda-Esquivel, D (2016) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_11>.
