These functions calculate the taxonomic measures presented in Posadas et al 2001 and in Miranda-Esquivel 2014 (in press) and introduce Jack-knife re-sampling in evolutionary distinctiveness prioritization analysis, as a way to evaluate the support of the ranking of the areas to modifications in the data used. In this way, some questions could be evaluated quantitatively as we could measure the confidence of the results, since deleting at random part of the information (phylogenies and/or distributions), would help to quantify the persistence of a given area in the ranking.
